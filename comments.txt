input file is named 'graph.txt' the format of the file is that the vertex names, which 
are taken as strings, should be given in a comma separated list on the first line. Then,
each edge should be placed on its own line as the first vertex's name a comma and then the
second vertices name.

The code requires the networkx package to run for the visualizations but the last for loop
can be removed otherwise and still see the results in the text file.

Note the graphs are unweighted, but all the code can be simply modified to allow weighted
graphs.
